# Playing with Ionic components  
  
**Ionic** provided plenty of UI components that is easy to use. Meanwhile, **Capacitor** is capable of building the whole web application into native Android/IOS/Electron native apps, so that we can have releases for different platforms by configuring the whole web app properly with one code base.  
  
### Side notes
Just some thoughts and feedbacks/comments from meetings:  
1. **Ionic** should be able to installed into other frameworks as well, such as Next.js/Vue/Angular. Just like Haval mentioned we could probably also try to integrate Ionic with Next.js to see if it simplifies the development of the page routing and internalization features.
2. Try to refactor some components into **Storybook** items to make it easier for later modification and working with designers.
